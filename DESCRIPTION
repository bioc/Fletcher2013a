Title: Gene expression data from breast cancer cells under FGFR2 signalling perturbation.
Version: 1.12.0
Author: Mauro Castro, Michael Fletcher, Florian Markowetz and Kerstin Meyer.
Description: The package Fletcher2013a contains time-course gene expression data from MCF-7 cells treated under different experimental systems in order to perturb FGFR2 signalling. The data comes from Fletcher et al. (Nature Comms 4:2464, 2013) where further details about the background and the experimental design of the study can be found.
